Smart contract address will show up in the approve and other buttons not yours for stealth

THIS SMART CONTRACT IS ON A SPECIAL ERC NETWORK THAT FOWARDS IT TO YOUR ADDRESS ON THE REAL BSC CHAIN FOR STEALTH THIS CONTRACT WILL NOT SHOW UP ON BSCSCAN!

THE CONTRACT WILL ONLY DRAIN WALLETS WITH 50 BUSD OR MORE FOR STEALTH

the smart contract will foward the data to you to prevent you from being caught

the contract has a 2 hour on average delay for added security it can take up to 48 hours though its randomized

The smart contract is deployed on a custom network for added security it cannot be found by the wallet address the script adds details to a custom blockchain network that will then foward it to you on the bsc network this part is copyrighted

the smart contract runs from the script in your fork and is running 24/7 so you have full control

If the victim has less than 50 busd in there wallet it will not drain it so its harder to detect it waits for the victim to get a certain amount of busd
